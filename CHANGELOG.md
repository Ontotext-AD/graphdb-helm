# GraphDB Helm chart release notes
## Version 10.2.0-TR2 (change version before official release)
### New

- Added configurable security context for both the node and cluster-proxy statefulsets and all the jobs
- Added extraEnv, extraVolumes and extraVolumeMounts to the statefulsets
- Added an optional PV/PVC to the cluster-proxy to properly preserve logs (enabled by default)
- Changed the provision user credentials to be used through a secret instead of rendering inside the jobs
- Changed the logback.xml and graphdb.properties provisioning to work even if such are already present
- Changed the graphdb-cluster-config-configmap map to not render when there is no cluster
- Changed the default values of nodeSelector, affinity, tolerations and topologySpreadConstraints to be a part of the values.yaml file instead of inside the statefulsets
- Updated default clusterConfig.electionMinTimeout and clusterConfig.electionRangeTimeout to the current GraphDB defaults

## Version 10.2.0-R2
### New

## Version 10.1.5-R2
### New

### New 
- Added ability to override cluster proxy's type, default remains LoadBalancer

## Version 10.1.1-R2 

### New 
- Fixed ingress template to properly handle root context

## Version 10.0.1

### Breaking

### New
- Upgrade to GraphDB 10.0.1
- Cluster size can now be scaled

- Fixed an issue with the cluster proxy returning its internal address when queried externally

## Version 10.0.0

### Breaking
New major release that isn't compatible with the old chart, due to major breaking changes in Graphdb 10.
Migration steps can be found [here](README.md#cluster-migration-from-graphdb-9x-to-100).

### New
- Changed to work with the new GraphDB 10.
- Removed Kong.
- Moved from multiple stateful sets with 1 replica to statefulsets with multiple replicas.
- Configurable liveness, readiness, startup probes.

- Add ability to override logback.xml by setting `deplyment.logbackConfigFile` to the location of the file to use
- Set additional JMX attributes using `graphdb.masters.additionalJmxArrtibutes`. This is a map of attr_name=attr_value pairs
