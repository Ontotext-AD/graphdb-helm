# This example shows how to deploy and expose GraphDB with Application Gateway Ingress with SSL certificate hosted in the KeyVault Service.

configuration:
  # Change this to your AzureDNS domain name or use nip.io which you can do after you deploy the chart since you
  # need to map the public IP address of the Application Gateway to the nip.io.
  externalUrl: https://ip.address.nip.io/

ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: azure-application-gateway
  annotations:
    # Set the name of the SSL certificate that you have in the KeyVault Service
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/appgw-ssl-certificate: "name-of-appgw-installed-certificate"
    # Enable SSL redirect on the listener
    appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"
