# This example shows how to deploy and expose GraphDB with GCP Load Balancer Controller Ingress with SSL enabled.

configuration:
  # Change this to your Google Domains domain name or use nip.io which you can do after you deploy the chart since you
  # need to map the public IP address of the GCP Ingress to the nip.io.
  externalUrl: https://ip.address.nip.io/
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: gce
  annotations:
    # This line could be omitted as GKE controller processes any Ingress that does not have
    # the annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.class, or has the annotation with the value gce
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: gce
    # Defines the name of the static IP address which the Ingress should use
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: ""
    # ManagedCertificate object which contains the domains for the SSL certificate
    networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: ""
