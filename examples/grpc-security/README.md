# Configuring cluster gRPC communication with SSL/TLS

This guide provides instructions for configuring GraphDB cluster gRPC communication with SSL/TLS. It details how to
configure it:
* Using JSSE: By providing keystore and truststore.
* Using OpenSSL: By providing certificate file, certificate chain, private key and truststore.
* Using a certificate without chain path: By providing certificate file, private key and truststore.

**Note:**
 - The message that indicates that the gRPC cluster security has been set up is logged at DEBUG level so your Logger
   should be configured accordingly.
 - If using standalone (self-signed) certificates for SSL/TLS configuration without a CA, and
   the same certificate is applied across all nodes, that certificate must be added to the truststore.
   However, if certificates are signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), the CA's root certificate
   (or intermediate certificates, if applicable) should be present in the truststore.
### See more about TLS/SSL set up:

## Warning

If cluster.tls.mode is set to TLS while one or more of the other TLS-related properties are not configured properly,
the server may not be able to start.

## Configuring using JSSE

**Prerequisites:**
* Certificate and certificate private key in PEM format
* Keystore that contains both the private key and certificate
* Truststore that contains the certificate to be trusted or the CA

[Configuration example](jsse.yaml)

## Configuring using OpenSSL

**Prerequisites:**
* Certificate and certificate private key in PEM format
* Valid certificate chain that contains the target certificate
* Truststore that contains the certificate to be trusted or the CA

[Configuration example](openssl.yaml)

## Configuring using certificate without certificate chain

**Prerequisites:**
* Certificate and certificate private key in PEM format.
* Truststore that contains the certificate to be trusted or the CA

[Configuration example](certWithoutChain.yaml)
