# Configuring Tomcat server with SSL/TLS

This guide provides instructions for configuring the embedded GraphDB Tomcat server with SSL/TLS.
There are 3 scenarios for configuring the security of the GraphDB instance:
- By providing a keystore.
- By providing keystore and truststore - used to configure mTLS.
- By providing a truststore - used in cases where GraphDB should trust an external service.

**Note:**
- If the Tomcat server is configured with SSL/TLS it will also configure the cluster gRPC communication SSL/TLS.
- If using standalone (self-signed) certificates for SSL/TLS configuration without a CA, and
  the same certificate is applied across all nodes, that certificate must be added to the truststore.
  However, if certificates are signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), the CA's root certificate
  (or intermediate certificates, if applicable) should be present in the truststore.

**Ingress**
If you are using the default nginx ingress controller, you must include the following annotation to ensure proper
communication between the ingress and the backend:
```yaml
ingress:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
```

## Configuring using keystore and truststore

**Prerequisites:**
* Certificate and certificate private key in PEM format.
* Keystore that contains both the private key and certificate.
* Truststore that contains the certificate to be trusted or the CA.

[Configuration example](keystoreAndTruststore.yaml)
